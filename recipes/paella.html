        <h2>Classic Spanish Paella</h2>
        <p> Paella is a rice dish originally from the Valencian Community. Paella is regarded as one of 
            the community's identifying symbols. It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>The dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on 
            an open fire, paella being the word for a frying pan in Valencian/Catalan language. 
            As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form, it is traced back to 
            the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the 
            city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.
