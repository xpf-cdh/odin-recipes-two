        <h2>Traditional Holiday Standing Rib Roast</h2>
        <p>
            A standing rib roast, also known as prime rib, is a cut of beef from the primal rib,
            one of the primal cuts of beef. While the entire rib section comprises ribs six 
            through 12, a standing rib roast may contain anywhere from two to seven ribs.

            Standing Rib Roast is considered by many to be the best roast beef in the world. 
            Also known as Prime Rib, it’s a beef cut that’s incredibly succulent with superior taste. 
            This recipe uses a safe, simple but highly effective roasting method so the beef is 
            blushing pink all the way through.
