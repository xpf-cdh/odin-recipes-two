    <h2>Northern Indian Style Vegetarian Thali</h2>
    <p>
        Thali (meaning "plate" or "tray") or Bhojanam (meaning "full meal") is a round platter used 
        to serve food in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Thali is also used to refer 
        to an Indian-style meal made up of a selection of various dishes which are served on a platter. 
        Thali is also used in south Asia for ceremonial purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every thali will have different dishes because we do have a wide variety 
        of Indian dishes. Also, you will find that a north Indian thali is very different 
        from a south Indian thali. And almost every Indian state has its own local dishes 
        that make up its version of the thali. So, no one can tell you that a thali must 
        have a certain dish.

        For this thali, I have chosen our family favorites 
        and the recipe for those is below in the recipe card.
